# Database 2 final project

This is the final project for the Database 2 course at Politecnico di Milano.  

## Description
The project consists of a web application, developed in Java, connected to a PostgreSQL database.

The projects aims to use:
* EJB, a persistence mechanism that is used to access the database in which the container manages the database related operations. Developers can access database using JDBC API call directly in EJB business methods.
* JPA (Java Persistence API) stands as an abstraction layer above the JDBC APIs, making the code for database independent data management and introducing the SQL-Like language, which allows queries on the Java model and not directly on the database.
